#Excel spreadsheets and CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files serve different purposes, and Excel offers several features that CSV files do not inherently support. 
#Here are some features that Excel spreadsheets have, which are not present in CSV spreadsheets:
    #Cell Formatting:
    #    Excel allows for extensive cell formatting, including font styles, colors, borders, and more. 
    #    CSV files only contain raw text data without any formatting.

    #Formulas and Functions:
    #    Excel supports a wide range of formulas and functions that can be applied to cells to perform calculations, data manipulation, and analysis. 
    #    CSV files only store plain text data and do not support formulas.

    #Charts and Graphs:
    #    Excel enables the creation of various charts and graphs based on the data present in the spreadsheet. 
    #    This visualization feature is not available in CSV files, which only store tabular data.

    #Multiple Sheets:
    #    Excel allows the creation of multiple sheets within a single workbook, facilitating the organization and categorization of data. 
    #    CSV files represent a single table of data and do not support multiple sheets.

    #Data Validation:
    #    Excel allows users to set up data validation rules to control the type and range of data entered in a cell. 
    #    CSV files do not have built-in support for data validation.

    #Cell Comments and Notes:
    #    Excel provides the ability to add comments and notes to individual cells, aiding in documentation and collaboration. 
    #    This feature is not available in CSV files.

    #Data Sorting and Filtering:
    #    Excel offers tools for sorting and filtering data within the spreadsheet easily. 
    #    CSV files store data without any inherent structure for sorting or filtering.

    #Data Protection and Security:
    #    Excel provides features like password protection and encryption for workbook security, restricting access to sensitive information. 
    #    CSV files do not have built-in security features.

    #Data Forms:
    #    Excel includes data forms that simplify data entry, especially for large datasets. 
    #    CSV files lack this user-friendly data entry interface.

    #PivotTables:
    #    Excel supports the creation of PivotTables for dynamic data summarization and analysis. 
    #    This functionality is not available in CSV files.
#While CSV files are lightweight and widely supported for basic data exchange, Excel provides a more robust environment for data analysis, visualization, and manipulation with additional features tailored for spreadsheet tasks.

#To create Reader and Writer objects using the csv module in Python, you need to pass file-like objects as arguments to csv.reader() and csv.writer(). 
#These file-like objects can be created using the built-in open() function or any other object that supports the required file operations.
#csv.reader():
import csv
# Example: Creating a Reader object
file_path = 'example.csv'
with open(file_path, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader_object = csv.reader(csvfile)
    # Now, 'reader_object' is an instance of the csv.reader class
    for row in reader_object:
        print(row)
#In this example, csv.reader() is used with an open file (csvfile) in read mode ('r'). 
#The newline='' argument is used to ensure that the newline character is handled consistently, regardless of the platform.
#csv.writer():
import csv
# Example: Creating a Writer object
file_path = 'example_output.csv'
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Now, 'writer_object' is an instance of the csv.writer class
    writer_object.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'City'])
    writer_object.writerow(['John Doe', 30, 'New York'])
    writer_object.writerow(['Jane Smith', 25, 'San Francisco'])
#In this example, csv.writer() is used with an open file (csvfile) in write mode ('w'). 
#The newline='' argument is included for consistent newline handling. The writerow() method is then used to write rows to the CSV file.

#When working with the csv.reader() and csv.writer() objects in Python, you need to open the file objects in specific modes. 
#Here are the recommended modes for each:
#csv.reader():
#For csv.reader(), you should open the file in read mode ('r'):
import csv
# Example: Opening file for reading with csv.reader()
file_path = 'example.csv'
with open(file_path, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader_object = csv.reader(csvfile)
    # Now, 'reader_object' is an instance of the csv.reader class
    for row in reader_object:
        print(row)
#csv.writer():
#For csv.writer(), you should open the file in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a'):
import csv
# Example: Opening file for writing with csv.writer()
file_path = 'example_output.csv'
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Now, 'writer_object' is an instance of the csv.writer class
    writer_object.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'City'])
    writer_object.writerow(['John Doe', 30, 'New York'])
    writer_object.writerow(['Jane Smith', 25, 'San Francisco'])
#Or, for append mode:
import csv
# Example: Opening file for appending with csv.writer()
file_path = 'example_output.csv'
with open(file_path, 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Now, 'writer_object' is an instance of the csv.writer class
    writer_object.writerow(['Alice Brown', 35, 'Chicago'])
    writer_object.writerow(['Bob Johnson', 28, 'Los Angeles'])
#In both cases, the newline='' argument is included for consistent newline handling. 
#It's important to choose the appropriate mode based on whether you are reading or writing data. 
#If you want to create a new file or overwrite an existing one, use 'w' for write mode. 
#If you want to append data to an existing file, use 'a' for append mode.

#The method that takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file using the csv module in Python is the writerow() method. 
#The writerow() method is part of the csv.writer object and is used to write a single row of data to the CSV file.
import csv
# Example: Writing a list to a CSV file using writerow()
file_path = 'example_output.csv'
data_to_write = ['Name', 'Age', 'City']
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile)
    # Using writerow() to write the list to the CSV file
    writer_object.writerow(data_to_write)
#In this example, the writerow() method is called on the csv.writer object (writer_object), and it takes a list (data_to_write) as an argument. 
#The elements of the list represent the values of a single row in the CSV file. 
#This method writes the values to the file and adds the necessary delimiter (comma by default) between them.
#You can use the writerow() method multiple times to write successive rows to the CSV file. 
#Each call to writerow() writes a new row based on the provided list.

#The delimiter and lineterminator are optional keyword arguments in the csv.writer class of the csv module in Python. 
#They allow you to customize the character that separates fields (columns) in a CSV file and the character that signifies the end of a line (row).
#delimiter:
#The delimiter keyword argument specifies the character used to separate fields (columns) in a CSV file. 
#By default, it is set to a comma (,), and hence, the term "Comma-Separated Values" (CSV). 
#However, you can customize it to another character if needed
import csv
file_path = 'example_custom_delimiter.csv'
data_to_write = ['Name', 'Age', 'City']
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    # Using a semicolon as the delimiter
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=';')
    writer_object.writerow(data_to_write)
#In this example, the delimiter=';' argument is used to set the semicolon (;) as the field separator.
#lineterminator:
#The lineterminator keyword argument specifies the character sequence used to terminate each line (row) in the CSV file. 
#By default, it is set to the newline character ('\n'). 
#However, you can customize it to another sequence if needed.
import csv
file_path = 'example_custom_lineterminator.csv'
data_to_write = ['Name', 'Age', 'City']
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    # Using a custom lineterminator (e.g., '\r\n' for Windows-style line endings)
    writer_object = csv.writer(csvfile, lineterminator='\r\n')
    writer_object.writerow(data_to_write)
#In this example, the lineterminator='\r\n' argument is used to set the Windows-style line endings.

#The function that takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure is json.loads(). 
#This function is part of the json module in Python and is used to deserialize (parse) a JSON-formatted string into a Python object.
import json
# Example: Using json.loads() to parse a JSON string
json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'
# Using json.loads() to convert the JSON string into a Python dictionary
python_data_structure = json.loads(json_string)
# Displaying the resulting Python data structure
print(python_data_structure)
#In this example, the json_string contains a JSON-formatted string representing an object with name, age, and city information. 
#The json.loads() function is then used to convert this string into a Python dictionary (python_data_structure). 
#The resulting Python data structure can be used as a native Python object.
#It's important to note that json.loads() is specifically used for deserializing JSON strings, whereas json.load() is used to deserialize JSON data from a file-like object. 
#If you have a JSON file, you would use json.load() with an open file instead of a JSON string.

#The function that takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data is json.dumps(). 
#This function is part of the json module in Python and is used to serialize (encode) a Python object into a JSON-formatted string.
import json
# Example: Using json.dumps() to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
python_data_structure = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
# Using json.dumps() to convert the Python dictionary to a JSON-formatted string
json_string = json.dumps(python_data_structure)
# Displaying the resulting JSON string
print(json_string)
#In this example, the python_data_structure is a Python dictionary containing information about a person. 
#The json.dumps() function is then used to convert this Python dictionary into a JSON-formatted string (json_string).
#It's important to note that json.dumps() is specifically used for serializing Python objects to JSON strings, whereas json.dump() is used to serialize Python objects to a file-like object. 
#If you want to write the JSON data to a file, you would use json.dump() with an open file instead of a JSON string.
