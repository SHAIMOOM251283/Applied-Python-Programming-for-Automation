# In Python, True and False are keywords representing the Boolean values True and False. They cannot be reassigned to other values.
#True = 2 + 2
#print(True)

# To fix this, you should use a different variable name for your assignment, avoiding the use of reserved keywords:
my_variable = 2 + 2
print(my_variable)
