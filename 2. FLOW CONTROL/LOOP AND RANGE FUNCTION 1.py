#The code will still function properly because the variable name (i, m, or any other valid variable name) used in the for loop is just a placeholder. 
#The significance of i is essentially that it represents the loop variable, and it helps you iterate over the sequence of values defined by range(5). 
#You can use any valid variable name in place of i without affecting the functionality of the loop.
#In summary, the significance of i in this context is that it's a conventionally used name for a loop variable, but you can replace it with other valid variable names without breaking the loop functionality.
